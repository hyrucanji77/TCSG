# Preregistration — Elliptic Sequention Potential (CC-BY-4.0)
B1: ≥10% RMSE reduction vs GLM/GP baselines on held-out DMS or morphogenesis; paired bootstrap p<0.01.
B2: Canalization order-invariance within ±5% on preregistered cone metrics.
Operator on genotype/GRN graph; μ_bio(y)= y/(1+y^m)^{1/m}, m∈{1,2}. Group-lasso sparsity; nested CV for λ on training only.
